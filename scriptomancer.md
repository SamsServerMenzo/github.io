# The Scriptomancer's Chant

In the dim glow of monitor's light, Where lines of code weave day into night, <br>
A sorcerer sits, fingers poised to dance, The Scriptomancer, in their digital trance.

They conjure spells not with wand or staff, But with semicolons, brackets, and math, <br>
Their syntax incantations, precise and clear, Shape realms of fantasy, both far and near.

Loops become enchantments, looping through time, Functions invoke creatures, both<br>
mundane and prime, Variables hold secrets, whispered in bytes, As the Scriptomancer <br>
weaves magic through a Neverwinter's night.

They debug the fabric of reality's weave, Unraveling glitches, ensuring all believe, <br>
That dragons and dungeons, quests and lore, Are more than mere dataâ€”they're magic galore.

So raise your virtual goblets, let's toast, To the Scriptomancer's passion, the code <br>
they host, For in their keystrokes lies a universe vast, Where imagination meets logic, <br>
and dreams forever last.
